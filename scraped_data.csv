I didn't know how to respond, so we continued and he followed us in and talked to the bartender in Greek as he made our (very expensive!) drinks. I don't know what he was saying, but he was gesturing towards us and the bartender was laughing awkwardly.  Once we had our drinks, we went outside and tried to find a seat. We saw someone sitting alone with 3 empty seats by him, and went over and asked if we could take the spare seats. He said there was someone sitting opposite, so we asked to take the two seats next to them, and he said ""Sorry, it's for 2 people."" So we said, ""Well, if we don't use the table, can we please take the chairs?"" he said that was OK, so we pulled the seats a short distance from the table and sat down, already feeling very awkward.

I has already noticed, when passing by, the new decoration and style of this coffee shop, aiming to attract students, as it looks like a studying hall. It is still a self service coffee shop, so we ordered a hot chocolate and a cup of coffee and chose to sit on the upper floor, where the only vacant seats were. The tea was extremely hot, so my friend burnt his tongue and was very angry with it. Don't they know that in order to prepare a proper cup of tea the water must not reach the boiling temperature? My chocolate dressed with whipped cream was served without a spoon, which annoyed me. The most irritating issue, though, was that the waiter appeared at 8.45 pm announcing that the upper floor will close in 10 minutes time! I asked him: Are you telling us to leave or will you find us another vacant place in the lower floor? He answered "" I do not know, this is not my job...!"" However, he did return 5 minutes later to inform and show us a table that had just become vacant. I really did not enjoy my stay at this coffee shop, and i do not look forward to return there.

The man working blocked my entrance and told me ""no"" without any explanation. I further explained that I was going to order a coffee, I just wanted to use the bathroom before I sat down. I tried to explain and make him see that I wanted to order something and stay there but he literally stood by the door holding the door open, motioning for me to leave. He then got angry at me, raising his voice to me and telling me, literally, these words: ""this café is different, this place is not for you."" From that, I'm guessing he was angry with me because I'm a tourist and I don't speak Greek. I understand 100% a place wanting you to place an order before you use their bathroom but he didn't even give me an opportunity to order and actually kicked me out of the café, embarrassing me in front of all the other guest there. I've traveled to 60 countries in my life and work in the travel industry, and I have never been kicked out of an establishment before even having a chance to order.

The sandwich I ordered was fair for the price, but was mostly cheap cheese and soft bread. Others drinks like the chocolate milk (€5.50!) are rich in chocolate, but the balance is off which makes it too heavy to drink.  I would say overall the menu is way overpriced.

Not sufficient social distancing. Tables were too close together, and chairs were literally back to back.  3. Food was mediocre. The bruschetti were terrible. The bread was not even the average bread you can get at any local bakery shop, it was ready-made sliced bread, the one you get at the supermarket! The beef tagliata was not great either, we were surprised not being asked how we would like it cooked, in fact it was served overdone.
