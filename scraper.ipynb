It's a place primarily for tea and I LOVED it. We went there with a huge group of friends and we all wanted coffee. The waiter insisted in trying a cup of tea each and every one and she said that if we didn't like it she would bring us coffee and we wouldn't have to pay. Well, it was a deal. She helped us pick a tea and she brought it in like 5 minutes (she was SO kind to all 10 of us). We literally LOVED every single sip of the tea we tasted, NO we didn't buy coffee at all. By the time we were drinking it we were making weird noses and the whole store could hear our surprise in what we were tasting. It wasn't really expensive, and even if it was trust me it was worth EVERY CENT. We actually bought some tea on our way out to try new things in our houses and we LOVED it all again.\n",

When we offered to come back in 30-40 minutes, he then said it might be longer. We accepted to come back even later, and he replied there was suddenly a new reservation, so we couldn't even come later. Seeing tables out front with dishes left from previous patrons, we asked if we could dine outside. He was distinctly unhappy about it, despite that others had clearly just left that table. As it was obvious he did not want us to dine at his restaurant, we decided to leave.

      "Argofageio, or Argophageio on Google maps, or Αργοφαγειο on the restaurant's signage is a great gem in a small place. I mentioned the names as I had a hard time telling the name to a taxi driver. I eventually used Uber app to book a taxi, so I didn't have to explain where I was going. When we got the the restaurant's name was in Greek, so I was afraid the taxi dropped us in an alley. I open the door, went down a couple of steps. They can seat a maximum of 15 people and only 2 customers were there finishing their meal. I thought I was in the wrong place, but then the waiter said my name.  Niko, the waiter, asked for our EU covid vaccine QR codes, but we are from the US, so we had our CDC cards. I said I called ahead and was told that our US cards would be okay. (Not all Greek restaurants will accept non-eu verifications). We were seated while he went to check. Then Niko brought out some menus written in pencil.  Gianis, the chef came out when we couldn't decide what to order. The waiter suggested a dry white wine to go with the pork chop, fish steak, artichokes, mushroom variety, calf tongue and salad we ordered. My daughter, whom my wife and I were visiting, told us that Greeks like to spend 1-2 hours over dinner. The food was so good, and we ate so fast, we forgot to take photos. We will have to take longer next time.  The pork chop was seared so that the outside was a little crispy, yet moist inside. The fish was actually shark. The shark, I've had in the past are usually pretty solid like scallops. This shark was flaky and moist, which almost melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were a blend of shiitake, portobello, porcini, and white. It was so good, the customers who came after us ordered it. The tongue was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. The wine wasn't very dry, but it paired well with the food.\n",

Small cheese stuffed packets with mint, eggs in a bed of spinach and onion, grilled Greek cheese smothered in carmelized onions, chickpea croquettes, and out-of- this-world sautéed mushrooms (3 varieties) in an abundant mustard- tinged wine sauce to sop up with excellent bread. The service was thoughtful, helpful, and nicely paced. The love of slow, artfully cooked food by chef Jannis really shines through.

It's in a cute and cozy spot with just a few tables. Excellent dry white and semi-sweet red wine. The owner is also engaged in important activism that entails making food available to those who are dealing with food insecurity (a group of chefs seeking to make a difference). The products at the restaurant are locally sourced and, I believe, are largely acquired directly from producers (χωρίς μεσάζοντες). And amazing prices. Will definitely be back next time we are in Thessaloniki! Ευχαριστούμε πολύ!\n",

      "A wonderful restaurant with very limited seating - we got lucky by coming right after some folks left. The couple that came in a few minutes later was turned down as there was not a single table available.  The guy running the place is super polite and speaks great English, he helped us pick the best dishes of the day and also guided us through the food philosophy of the place.  I have to say that the food was outstanding. Simple, delicious and beautifully presented. The wine is also decent.  One thing is that it's not a '45 minute dinner break' place, it is rather for the people who can afford to spend a couple of hours and enjoy the food, the discussion and the atmosphere of the place - there is only one person serving all tables, but he makes sure that he dedicates time to attend to every guest.  If you can have just 1 dinner in Thessaloniki, go here.\n",

Our experience was so good in terms of the quality of food, interpretation, presentation, human communication, affect... that we do not forget this restaurant in all of our lives. We love the restaurant, the greek people, the generosity of the workers and daily clients. Good fish, salads, meat, wines, beers... and cheaper for middle class. It was one of my best experiences in restaurants in all of my life. I recommend highly. The restaurant is a little hidden and the experiencie could be for the life memories.

      "The reviews from TA inspired our visit for Argofageio for lunch, we were looking for it on google maps but couldn’t find it...we walked back down the street and then came across it!  Don’t be put off by the uncommercial exterior, this little restaurant is serving top quality traditional Greek food! Our waiter Nick was so friendly and was also very helpful when we were choosing a selection of dishes from the menu. The food is fresh and seriously flavorsome! We had beautiful dishes like Feta Saganaki, Dolmades (stuffed vine leaves) and baked aubergines to name a few! The portion sizes are good for all of the dishes, which we had served with lovely warm bread. We also had ordered the house white wine which was lovely. This restaurant is excellent value for money and well worth a visit!\n",

The two members of staff who served us, I assume manager and owner, were very warm, friendly and provided us with a very personal experience. I had vegetarian food and although two of the three vegetarian main menu items had been finished the chef kindly made me a falafel style aubergine plate. The desert was delicious (small cheesecake in a shot glass). The starters we had included artichoke and beetroot. The whole meal including drinks was under 40 euros.\n",

      "'Argofageio' means something like 'slow eating'. I get the idea of the owner but one can't eat slow there as everything is extremely delicious. The food is traditional and simple as well as the furniture. The waiter (who looks like a drunk, talks like a drunk and is actually drunk) was very cute and friendly and explained to us that if they do not find the proper, high quality products for a dish, they just do not add it in the menu (written on a black board) that day.\n",

      "As a person who has traveled to Greece before, I've got to say I never ever had a better Greek salad than here, at Argophageio. Cheesy as it sounds, I was delighted to taste the best salad ever, with what it felt like home grown sweet juicy tomatoes. We visited the restaurant in a group of 5 and as we had various dishes, everybody was pleased beyond satisfaction with what we've been served. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! Nikos will take good care of you and your table while Yannis, the chef, if you are lucky enough to meet him, will delight you with his stories and, most likely, treat you with some goodies on the house.

Now, you make sure you go to Argofageio with some good appetite. For some extraordinary flavors, if not the joy of life. Be open to new colors on your palette. Be appreciative of the depth of culture. Be prepared for a gastronomical journey across continents and through time. Or save the seat and go somewhere else. This place is a gem this exclusive. One of the reasons I’m moving to Thessaloniki for. And because it’s a top European city. I know - I’ve been around ✌⭐️\n",

Dressed poor. No teeth. He apparently was involved cause he was giving loud directions to the waiter. And did it during our dinner many more time in between all of his cigarettes and ouzo. Not the best advertisement for your business. The steak was a baked slize om ham. My dinnerpartner always finishes her food but stopped in the middle too. All in all. Why is this rated so high??\n",

There are a lot of options, even vegetarian ones and the food is really great and not expensive at all! Really recommend this one!\n",
